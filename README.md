  <h2>Introducing Analisis-Web: Empowering Individuals with Advanced Wound Care Solutions</h2>
  <p>Welcome to Analisis-Web, a cutting-edge website specifically designed to assist individuals in recognizing and treating a wide range of wounds. Whether you're dealing with a basic scratch or a pesky splinter, severe burns, allergies, or even more complex injuries, our advanced AI-powered platform is here to provide you with accurate diagnoses and effective treatment suggestions.</p>
  <h3>Harnessing the Power of GPT and Neural Networks</h3>
  <p>At Analisis-Web, we leverage the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, specifically GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), and neural networks to revolutionize the way wounds are identified and treated. Our state-of-the-art algorithms have been trained on vast datasets, enabling them to recognize various types of wounds with exceptional accuracy.</p>
  <h3>The Analytical Process: From Identification to Treatment</h3>
  <p>When you visit Analisis-Web, our intelligent system guides you through a simple yet comprehensive process. First, you'll be prompted to provide information about the wound, including its location, size, and any relevant symptoms or characteristics. This initial input helps our AI models narrow down the possibilities and generate a list of potential diagnoses.</p>
  <p>Next, utilizing our powerful GPT models, Analisis-Web carefully analyzes the data you've provided, comparing it to extensive knowledge and patterns within its vast database. Through a combination of machine learning and deep neural networks, the system identifies the most likely wound type, taking into account various factors such as appearance, symptoms, and contextual information.</p>
  <p>Once the diagnosis is determined, Analisis-Web goes a step further by recommending appropriate treatment options tailored to the specific wound. Our platform draws upon a comprehensive database of medical literature and expert advice to provide evidence-based recommendations, ensuring that you receive the most suitable and effective course of action.</p>
  <h3>User-Friendly Interface for Enhanced Accessibility</h3>
  <p>We understand the importance of simplicity and accessibility when it comes to healthcare solutions. That's why Analisis-Web features a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the process, input relevant information, and receive clear and concise results. Our intuitive design ensures that even those with limited technical knowledge can benefit from our AI-powered wound recognition and treatment system.</p>
  <h3>Continual Improvement through User Feedback</h3>
  <p>At Analisis-Web, we believe in the power of user feedback to drive continuous improvement. We encourage our users to provide insights and suggestions, helping us refine our algorithms and enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of our platform. By fostering a collaborative relationship with our user community, we strive to stay at the forefront of wound care innovation.</p>

  <h3 style="color: #555;">TODO</h3>
  <ul>
    <li style="color: #666;">- Might change so it doesn't ask for camera in each website</li>
    <li style="color: #666;">- Need to organize CSS</li>
    <li style="16px; color: #666;">- We need to make the website work on phones (or create a new one specifically for phones)</li>
    <li style="color: #666;">- Further design with more animations and an overall smoother look (main CSS)</li>
    <li style="color: #666;">- Upload the website to a web address (analisis-ai.com // analisis-medical.com)</li>
