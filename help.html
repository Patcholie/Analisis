        <h2>Helpful Tips:</h2>
        <ul class="fact-list">
          <li class="f anim-typewriter4">
            Try to write informative prompts, describe how you got the injury, how
            does the injury feel (itching, hot, etc.) and such, though don't write
            too much.
          </li>
          <li class="f anim-typewriter3">
            Try to center the injury in the middle of the camera (The + in the
            middle of the live camera view) for best results.
          </li>
          <li class="f anim-typewriter2">
            Try to be as accurate as you can when it comes to the pain level (The
            description of the pain level does not need to exactly describe how
            painful the injury is).
          </li>
          <li class="f anim-typewriter4">
            The selections under the 'ANALISIS' button should describe how much
            available resources you have at your place (It does not have to be
            accurate).
          </li>
          <li class="f anim-typewriter1">
            The body part selection is meant to help the output be more accurate,
            try to select the area that fits the best.
          </li>
          <li class="f anim-typewriter3">
            Soon we will add more features and make ANALISIS more accurate and
            overall better (Including UI Changes, Model Changes, etc.).
